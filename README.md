# ProperNameFormattingLibrary

Kodapor (Code Monkeys, Swedish FaceBook Group), Friday challange "ProperNameFormattingLibrary" 2020-06-05 (ISO 8601-date format)
Issues and suggestments for improvement is appreciated. Just add yourself as contributor 
and add the issue or mejl directly to me at uppdrag@connywesth.se

Challange: Create a DLL component that manages all the testcases in the unit test.

Prerequsites: Test framework used is MSTest 
and the development environment beeing used is: 
Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 version 16.6.1 Community Edition. (latest update at 2020-06-05)

Please use C#, VB.NET, C++ or another programming language 
availible in the specified version of Visial Studio.

Create the most elegant object oriented solution.
No "cheating" by using other peoples published 
work as your own. It has to be your own solution and code.
 
The solution should format the names to proper 
casing as specified in the test suite.

I found a mighty old book in my bookshelf about 
design patterns in VB.NET and VB6 published 
in 2002  written by James W. Cooper.
By playing with those simple designpatterns like 
the factory pattern in the book inspired med to 
create this challange for other code monkeys like myself.

I made a sample project for properly formattning 
peoples names. After some time playing with this 
challange, I thought this could be an interesting 
challange to ither code monkeys like me.
 
Here I provide a start for a solution, that is 
not at all done yet. But it's a tedious tak so 
I give you some head start by providing what 
I achived so far.

You can of cource make your own solution, but 
make sure all the tests "Test 211" - "Test 218"
are fullfilled, with all the proper casing included.

Hope you enjoy the challange!

I suggest using any of .NET Framework eller .NET Core.

The winner of the challange gets respect, 
honor and fame in the code monkey community!

use your favorite licensing model. The project 
is a playful enjoyable challange among other
dedicated code monkeys, NOT a commercial 
project of any kind, so dont expect to be 
rewarded financially..

You can for instance publish the solution 
at GitHub and put a link in the discussion 
thread at the FB group "Kodapor", if the 
administrators allow it. Otherwise you can 
send med an email with your solution or 
link to your GitHub-project.

Please have a happy coding day....
